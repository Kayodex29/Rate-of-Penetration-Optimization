This project aims to develop a model for predicting the rate of penetration using surface drilling parameters. The objective of this project is to better understand the complex interaction between surface drilling parameters (Weight on Bit, Flow Rate, Pump Pressure, Rotary Speed) and Lithology in respect to the Rate of Penetration.
